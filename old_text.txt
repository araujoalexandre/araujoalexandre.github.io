I am a 3rd year PhD candidate in Computer Science at <a class="desc-links" href="https://www.psl.eu/en">Universit√© Paris-Dauphine PSL</a>. I am currently working within the <a class=desc-links href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/wp/miles/">Machine Learning and LEarning System</a> team under the supervision of Pr. Jamal Atif, Pr. Yann Chevaleyre and Dr. Benjamin Negrevergne. Before starting a PhD in Machine Learning, I studied Mathematics for two years at the University of Versailles and three years as part of a master's degree in Economics and Project Management at SKEMA Business School. During the course of my PhD, I have focused on how to leverage the properties of structured matrices to improve the training of neural networks.
