I recently finished my postdoc in the <a class="desc-links" href="https://wp.nyu.edu/ensure_group/">EnSuRe Research Group</a> at NYU. I worked with <a class="desc-links" href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/siddharth-garg">Siddharth Garg</a> and <a class="desc-links" href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/farshad-khorrami">Farshad Khorrami</a> on Trustworthy Machine Learning.

I am currently looking for a Research Scientist/Engineer position.

Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at <a class="desc-links" href="https://www.inria.fr/en">INRIA</a> and <a class="desc-links" href="https://www.ens.psl.eu/en">École Normale Supérieure</a> (ENS) in the <a class="desc-links" href="https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/index.php">WILLOW project-team</a> in Paris, France.
I obtained my PhD in Computer Science in June 2021 at Université Paris Dauphine-PSL where I was advised by Pr. Jamal Atif, Pr. Yann Chevaleyre and Dr. Benjamin Negrevergne.
