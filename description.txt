I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at <a class="desc-links" href="https://www.inria.fr/en">INRIA</a> and <a class="desc-links" href="https://www.ens.psl.eu/en">École Normale Supérieure</a> (ENS) in the <a class="desc-links" href="https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/index.php">WILLOW project-team</a> in Paris, France.
I work with Jean Ponce and Julien Mirail on Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
I obtain my PhD in Computer Science in June 2021 at Université Paris Dauphine-PSL where I was advised by Pr. Jamal Atif, Pr. Yann Chevaleyre and Dr. Benjamin Negrevergne.
During the course of my PhD, I have focused on how to leverage the properties of structured matrices to improve the training of neural networks.
